# Bowls
## Himalayan Singing Bowl
### Team: Biqiao Zhang, Zachary Boulanger, and Antonio D. de Carvalho J.

Biqiao 'Didi' Zhang was the composer of this piece and I participated with Zachary Boulanger as partners during the development of the mobile application. 
In this piece we simulate a himalayan singing bowl through multiple mobile devices. 
One person is the 'conductor'/'leader' of the performance and this person controls which note the devices are playing (e.g. C3) and how people should be moving their devices. 
Ideally, only the performers know who the leader is.
The performers will all be standing in a circle on stage, facing inward. 
They move their devices up and down to control the volume and left and right to control the 'beating' of the sound. 
The color on their screen changes with their movement. 
A projector displays a video of a singing bowl, so the audience knows what the performance is based on.

The difference in frequencies by each performer, their place on the stage, and the changing color of the screen mimicking their movements all provide a unique spatial element to the performance. 
The absence of a clearly defined conductor also lends to the idea of circular performance with everyone following everyone elseâ€™s movements and actions. 
This shows that the performance not only simulates the singing bowls musically, but in a physical aspect as well.
The sound is simulating an actual singing bowl, with the performers forming the bowl itself. 
Each person has a different frequency than those next to them, giving a spatial element to the musical experience. 
The performance is then made more musically interesting with the addition of different pitches, dynamics, and 'beating'. 
This is where our simulation grows and differs from the original, making the performance something new entirely.

The premiere was held on April 18, 2015 in Stamps Auditorium at the Walgreen Drama Center on the U-M North Campus.
